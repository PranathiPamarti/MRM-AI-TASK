Project Overview
This project predicts car prices using a custom linear regression model built from scratch. The dataset includes features such as engine size, horsepower, and fuel type. The process involves:

Data Preprocessing: Categorical features are encoded into numerical values, and all data is normalized to a 0-1 scale.
Linear Regression Implementation: A simple linear regression model is created using gradient descent to minimize error and fit the best weights for prediction.
Model Evaluation: The modelâ€™s performance is measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE) on test data.
